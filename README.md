# Training Repository

This is the repository for Steven.
I am happy to have Steven as a partner. He is already a pro at git :smile:

I think I am going to put about 6 lines of text in this file.
That way we should get a conflict.
But, if we don't, I will keep trying to create one because he will enjoy resolving it!
